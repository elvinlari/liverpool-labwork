    "\n",
    "A function is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific tasks and produce output. They allow us to break down a program into re-usable, simple components. Functions enable programmers to reuse a piece of code multiple times in the future. Python has several functions that are readily available for use. These functions are called built-in functions. The programmers can define their own functions to perform certain tasks. These functions are called user-defined functions. Different combinations of built-in and user-defined functions create code to solve complex tasks, in a way it ensures that the codes are readable and easily maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've already come across many functions, one of the most common ones being the `print()` function. The objects that you pass into a function are called arguments. Generally, you should pass whatever variables that the function uses into the function as arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various kinds of arguments, which can add to the flexibility of a function. If we look at the definition of the print function, then we can see some different types of arguments. The definition is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The first argument, objects, means the print function accepts any number of objects as arguments (using means it can take any number of arguments, which is why when you use the print function you can pass in as many objects separated by commas as you wish). The Print() function put objects to the text stream file (converted arguments to strings like `str()` does), separated by sep and followed by end.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are arguments with default values, if these are not provided a default is used. Let's modify one of these now."
